// ? find a constellation API for information etc

//? Probably use react spring and animejs

// ? landing page idea, have a website about constellations in space--- because that can look cool with frontend effects use parralax scrolling with something like this, would be cool with a really space theme?

//? think can find a high defition photo somewhere of like that or something

//? find constellations with SVG and can animate them in a cool way like click and the constellation dots then connect to make the constellations with lines--- would be SICKKKK
